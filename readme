- when a call is initiated, create producers and consumers in advance and return in Welcome?
	KnockKnock -> Welcome { rtp_caps }
- introduce waiting rooms

TODO: introduce authentication
FIXME: send some signals directly to the room?

add room_tx to Peer?

TODO: specify effect deps properly, especially related to video layers

add more error handling in js

- Safari doesn't like negative margins and paddings
- Safari doesn't send Websocket::disconnect on Cmd + Q (Cmd + W works fine). It does eventually emit ice::Disconnected in around 30 s -> use it?

associate consumer with producer_peer_id and delete all on onPeerLeft, if any left

producer.setMaxSendingSpatialLayer() to specify layers MANUALLY by the sender

flow:

/join?userId={USER_ID}
/join?userId={USER_ID}&roomId={ROOM_ID}
